# Twitter Character Count UI Component

## Overview

This project implements a UI component that allows users to input text and track the character count relative to Twitter's character limit. It also handles special cases where characters such as emojis and extended Unicode characters are counted differently. The component stops counting once the limit is reached, ensuring that the input does not exceed Twitter's allowed character count.

## Features

- Tracks character count based on Twitter's character counting rules.
- Stops counting characters once the tweet exceeds the character limit.
- Modular design with clean code architecture.
- Integration with Twitter API (for posting tweets).


## Requirements

- Android Studio (latest version)
- Kotlin
- Twitter SDK/API (for posting tweets)
